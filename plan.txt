To build a **production-quality Personal Finance Tracker** as an Android app with a **Spring Boot** backend and **React Native** frontend within a tight **2-day (10-12 hour)** timeframe, we’ll create a robust, industry-standard project that prioritizes essential features, modern technologies, and best practices while excluding complex tasks like SMS parsing. The focus will be on **user-entered transactions**, budget management, bill tracking, and carryover ("bonus money") calculations, ensuring the project is resume-worthy and demonstrates proficiency in microservices, mobile development, and software engineering principles. We’ll use **open-source technologies** and frameworks aligned with production-grade standards, adhering to design patterns, SOLID principles, and clean code practices.

Below is a refined, detailed **step-by-step plan** to structure the project, set up microservices, and execute development in **10-12 hours** over **2 days**. The plan assumes your environment (VS Code, JDK 17, Maven, Node.js, Android Studio) is set up as per previous guidance. Complex features like SMS parsing and push notifications are deferred to keep the scope manageable, but we’ll include industry-standard tools and practices to ensure the project mirrors production apps.

---

### Project Scope (MVP)
To meet the 2-day timeline and deliver a high-quality, production-like MVP, we’ll focus on:
- **Backend (Spring Boot)**:
  - **Microservices**: Transaction Service, Budget Service, Bill Service, Analytics Service.
  - **Features**:
    - User-entered transactions (amount, merchant, category, date) via REST APIs.
    - Category-based budget management (set and track monthly budgets).
    - Bill tracking (add bills with due dates and paid status).
    - Carryover calculations (underspending saved as "bonus money").
  - **Database**: H2 in-memory with Hibernate for ORM.
  - **Technologies/Frameworks**:
    - Spring Boot 3.2.x for microservices.
    - Spring Data JPA (Hibernate) for database operations.
    - Spring Web for REST APIs.
    - Spring Boot Actuator for monitoring endpoints (production standard).
    - OpenAPI (Swagger) for API documentation.
    - JUnit 5 for unit tests.
    - Maven for dependency management.
  - **Design Patterns**: Repository, Factory, DTO.
  - **SOLID Principles**: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Dependency Inversion.
- **Frontend (React Native)**:
  - Screens: Home (budget summary, carryover), Transactions (add/list), Budgets (set/list), Bills (add/list).
  - Basic, clean UI with navigation and API integration.
  - **Technologies/Frameworks**:
    - React Native for cross-platform mobile development.
    - Axios for HTTP requests.
    - React Navigation for screen navigation.
    - React Native Paper for Material Design components.
    - ESLint for code linting (production standard).
- **Deferred Features**:
  - SMS parsing (complex and time-intensive).
  - Push notifications (FCM setup deferred).
  - Periodic savings goals (e.g., clothes every other month).
  - User authentication (assume single user for simplicity).
  - Advanced spending suggestions (basic budget tracking for now).

---

### Why This Is Production-Grade
- **Open-Source Tech Stack**: Uses industry-standard, open-source tools (Spring Boot, Hibernate, React Native, H2, Maven, Axios, React Navigation).
- **Best Practices**:
  - Clean code with meaningful naming and modular structure.
  - API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger.
  - Unit tests for critical components.
  - Monitoring with Spring Boot Actuator.
  - Linting (ESLint) for frontend code quality.
- **Scalability**: Microservices architecture allows independent scaling.
- **Maintainability**: Design patterns and SOLID principles ensure extensibility.
- **Resume Impact**: Demonstrates full-stack skills, modern architecture, and production-ready practices.

- **Frontend**: A React Native project for the Android app.
- **README**: Documents features, architecture, patterns, SOLID principles, and setup instructions.

---

### Microservices Architecture
We’ll implement four microservices to balance functionality and time constraints:
1. **Transaction Service**:
   - Handles user-entered transaction CRUD (amount, merchant, category, date).
   - REST APIs: `/api/transactions` (POST, GET).
   - Port: 8081.
2. **Budget Service**:
   - Manages category budgets (categoryId, amount, startDate, endDate).
   - REST APIs: `/api/budgets` (POST, GET).
   - Port: 8082.
3. **Bill Service**:
   - Manages bills (name, amount, dueDate, paid).
   - REST APIs: `/api/bills` (POST, GET).
   - Port: 8083.
4. **Analytics Service**:
   - Calculates spending per category and carryover (budget - spending).
   - REST APIs: `/api/analytics/summary` (GET).
   - Port: 8084.

**Communication**: Services use `RestTemplate` for REST API calls. No service discovery (e.g., Eureka) to save time.

**Database**: Each service uses a separate H2 in-memory database (`jdbc:h2:mem:<service-name>`).

**Production Features**:
- **OpenAPI/Swagger**: API documentation at `/swagger-ui.html`.
- **Actuator**: Health checks at `/actuator/health`.
- **Logging**: SLF4J with Logback for structured logging.
- **Testing**: JUnit 5 for service layer tests.

---

### Design Patterns and SOLID Principles
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts database access.
- **Factory Pattern**: Creates transaction objects (extensible for future parsing).
- **DTO Pattern**: Ensures clean API responses.
- **SOLID**:
  - **S (Single Responsibility)**: Each service handles one domain.
  - **O (Open/Closed)**: Budget and transaction logic extensible for new types.
  - **D (Dependency Inversion)**: Spring IoC for repositories and services.

### Development Plan (2 Days, 10-12 Hours)
The plan is split into **Day 1 (6 hours)** and **Day 2 (5-6 hours)**, optimized for a production-quality outcome. Each step includes tasks, estimated time, learning outcomes, and how it aligns with industry standards.

#### Day 1: Backend Development (6 Hours)
Focus on building and testing the Spring Boot microservices with production-grade features.

**Step 1: Initialize Project Structure (30 minutes)**
- **Tasks**:
  - Create root folder: `C:\Projects\personal-finance-tracker`.
  - Inside `backend/`, create folders: `transaction-service`, `budget-service`, `bill-service`, `analytics-service`.

  - Open `personal-finance-tracker` in VS Code (**File** > **Open Folder**).
  - Save workspace as `PersonalFinanceTracker.code-workspace`.
  - Initialize a Git repository (`git init`) and create a `.gitignore` (exclude `target/`, `node_modules/`).
- **Learning**: Project organization, Git setup.
- **Industry Standard**: Modular structure and version control are standard in production.
- **Why**: Ensures a clean, scalable project layout.

**Step 2: Generate Spring Boot Microservices (1 hour)**

    - **Transactions Screen**: Form to add transactions (POST to `/api/transactions`) and list transactions (GET from `/api/transactions`).
    - **Budgets Screen**: Form to set budgets (POST to `/api/budgets`) and list budgets (GET from `/api/budgets`).
    - **Bills Screen**: Form to add bills (POST to `/api/bills`) and list bills (GET from `/api/bills`).
  - Use Axios for API calls to backend services.
  - Apply basic styling with React Native Paper (e.g., Material Design buttons, cards).
  - Ensure ESLint compliance (run `npx eslint .` and fix warnings).
  - Test in emulator:
    - Start all backend services (`mvn spring-boot:run`).
